        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup warm whole milk, 105-110 degrees F</li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm water, 105-110 degrees F</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, divided</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, water, yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar and salt in a small bowl; 
                let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter, 
                1/2 cup Parmesan and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 
                about 2-3 minutes. Beat in egg until well combined. Beat in yeast mixture and 2 1/2 cups flour until a smooth batter forms.</li>
            <li>Using the dough hook, gradually add remaining 1 to 1 1/4 cups flour, 
                1/2 cup at a time, until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed. The dough should feel elastic and slightly tacky to the touch. 
                Increase speed to medium-high and beat for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl or coat with nonstick spray; place dough in bowl, turning to coat. 
                Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Gently deflate dough by punching down. Roll into a 15-inch rope; cut into 15 1-inch pieces, pressing each piece into a disk, then shaping into a ball.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a 9Ã—13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray. Place dough balls into the prepared baking dish; brush tops with butter and sprinkle with garlic. 
                Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle dough with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 18-22 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve warm, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
