        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> 1/3 cup rolled oats avoid instant, steel-cut oats will need soaking with hot water for 30-60 minutes then rinsing thoroughly if using.</li>
            <br>
            <li>3/4 cup water filtered</li>
            <br>
            <li>2 tablespoon coconut oil flavorless if needed; or use other neutral oils that won't solidify when chilled</li>
            <br>
            <li>pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Step 1: Blend</h4>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all of the ingredients to your high speed blender and blend for twenty seconds.</li>
            <br>
            <li>You may need thirty seconds if your machine isn’t as powerful/high-speed.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Step 2: Strain</h4>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Filter the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or nut milk bag. However, be careful not to squeeze or press the mixture, as that can encourage sliminess. Allow it to strain naturally.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once strained, it's ready to use immediately or transfer to a jar and store in the fridge.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you find the results a little too thin for your liking, then increase the amount of oats used or reduce the water.</li>
            <br>
            <li>By adding more water to the prepared cream, you can make super quick oat milk.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Just like with oat milk, if you blend too long, this cream can end up ‘slimy’ so stick to the times mentioned.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Adding the creamer to coffee will thicken it slightly, but shouldn’t go gooey.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pre-soaking isn’t necessary when using a high-speed blender. However, if you only have a less powerful machine then soaking the oats in hot water for 30 minutes is more than enough. then drain the water and rinse the oats well. This will soften them just enough without encouraging sliminess.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It’s best to avoid squeezing the mixture when straining it, instead let it drip slowly/naturally. When squeezing you’re more likely to get slimy results.</li>
            <br>
            <li>You can add a handful of cashews to this oat creamer for even creamier results. ( best soaked for 30 minutes in hot water so that they blend within the 30 seconds).</li>
        </ul>
